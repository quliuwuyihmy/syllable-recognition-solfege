# syllable-recognition-solfege
Syllable (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, ...) recognition for solfege

Experimented in python 3.6

An half-way work, using pomegranate HMM model train monophone HMM, 
and concatenate them for alignment and recognition.

It doesn't work well as expected.

```bash
python main_alignment.py
```

```bash
python main_recognition.py
```
